# A note from a Walkum studio musician:

Walkum Records isn't your big-tech answer to music production. If you're trying to be swept up by distribution algorithms, you may find a quicker fix somewhere else for the type of thrill you may be after.

If you're willing to consider that great artistry happens independent of distribution, we'd be thrilled to work with you.

<span class="green">**Walkum Records is a musical arts catalogue developer**</span>. Our goal is the thrill of the art, not the thrill of a hit song.

Thanks for visiting :) Here is a parting thought:

"Jazz lifted up improvisation to public awareness and mastered it more than any other art form." - [Theo Katzman](https://youtu.be/6e0wsD-_D3A)
