# I'm a musician. How do I work with Walkum Records?

</div>

# Step 1:

Send a demo audio/video file of your playing. Showcase yourself. Upload it to the internet and email a link to ddaaggeett.org@gmail.com.

We can get a general understanding of your musicianship with a simple phone camera/microphone in order to decide how we'd be useful to you. Provide whatever record quality you wish.

# Step 2:

In your email, make clear the following:

"Hey, Walkum..."

<div class="center">

|  Price $   | Service (Customer POV) |
|----------|------------|
| 0        | "Check out my new sounding demo."        |
| 25        | "Listen intently to my demo."        |
| 75        | "Record an instrumental track how you see fit with this and send it back to me."</br>(Available instruments include what is demonstrated in [Walkum's house band releases](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAFFCFbWF1lHAQ2mS_LO-Y7xWIFuVOGhK).)        |
| 100        | "Record a track how I see fit and send it back."        |
| 200        | "Mix the two tracks and send it back."        |
| 550        | "Produce my whole song accompanied with an official instrumental record video."</br>(typically 3 tracks added by Walkum)        |
| 1550        | "Produce my whole song **AND** Walkum Records' studio musicians do not visually appear in my official music video (custom video)."        |

# A note from a Walkum studio musician:

Walkum Records isn't your big-tech answer to music production. If you're trying to be swept up by distribution algorithms and are interested in fame, you may find a quicker fix somewhere else for the type of thrill you're after.

Or if you're willing to consider great art is made independent of distribution, we'd be thrilled to work with you.

**Walkum Records is a musical arts catalogue developer**. Our goal is the thrill of the art, not the thrill of a hit song.

Thanks for visiting :)

In the valuable [words of Theo Katzman](https://youtu.be/6e0wsD-_D3A): "Jazz lifted up improvisation to public awareness and mastered it more than any other art form."
