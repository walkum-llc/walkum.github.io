# <span class="green">I'm a musician</span>.</br>How do I work with Walkum Records?

</div>

## Step 1:

Send a demo audio/video file of your playing. Showcase yourself. Upload it to the internet and email a link to walkum.llc@gmail.com.

We can get a general understanding of your musicianship with a simple phone camera/microphone in order to decide how we'd be useful to you. Provide whatever record quality you wish.

## Step 2:

In your email, make clear the following service you'd like to receive.

If we feel we can be a fruitful match, we'll be in touch.

"Hey, Walkum..."

<div class="center">

| Price | Service (Customer POV) |
|----------|------------|
| 0        | "Check out my new sounding demo."        |
| 25       | "Listen intently to my demo." (Guarantees a response from Walkum)        |
| 75       | "Record an instrumental track how you see fit with this and send it back to me."</br>(Available instruments include those recorded in [Walkum's record catalogue](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAFFCFbWF1lHAQ2mS_LO-Y7xWIFuVOGhK).)        |
| 100      | "Record a track how I see fit and send it back."        |
| 250      | "Mix the two tracks and send it back."        |
| 600      | "Produce my whole song with 3 added Walkum tracks accompanied by an official instrumental record video."</br>(Option to add tracks)        |
| 1600     | "Produce my whole song **AND** Walkum Records' studio musicians do not visually appear in my official music video."</br>(custom video)        |

# A note from a Walkum studio musician:

Walkum Records isn't your big-tech answer to music production. If you're trying to be swept up by distribution algorithms, you may find a quicker fix somewhere else for the type of thrill you may be after.

If you're willing to consider that great artistry happens independent of distribution, we'd be thrilled to work with you.

<span class="green">**Walkum Records is a musical arts catalogue developer**</span>. Our goal is the thrill of the art, not the thrill of a hit song.
