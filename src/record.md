# How should I <span class="green">record myself</span>?

We'll walk you through how we do it.

## Step 1: Tooling

You'll need hardware. It's all preferential. We take a minimal approach. Here's what we use:

- Audio interface: [Behringer UM2](https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=0805-AAL)
- Microphone: [AT2020](https://www.audio-technica.com/en-us/at2020) mic that sits underneath the snare drum that picks up a 3-piece kit quite well.
- Compression pedal: [EBS MultiComp Blue Label](https://ebssweden.com/content2/effects/ebs-multicomp-blue-label/)
- Sunglasses

Choose your recording method:

- We use [OBS studio](https://obsproject.com/) to record audio and video simultaneously. It packages the recording into a single video for simplicity. A USB webcam works just great.

- Record audio and video separately. A phone camera works fine.

Regardless of your recording method, we prefer to record with a audio bit rate of <span class="green">48kHz</span> and a video frame rate of <span class="green">60fps</span>.

## Step 2: Sync Audio + Video <img src="./images/clapper01.png" alt="clapper" class="clapper">

"And, ACTION!"

Once both audio and video are recording, use a following method immediately before you begin performing.

- Microphone: Face the camera and into the microphone, clap your hands 3 times.
- Drums (microphone): Just play. The audio waves spike just like hand claps.
- Instrument cable (guitar): Turn guitar so the headstock is pointing to the camera looking down the length of the neck and with your pickup hand visible on the strings, slap the strings 3 times.
- Keyboard: With a single finger, tap a single key 3 times.
